# BehaVR
>VR platforms offer diverse applications but raise privacy concerns due to their sensors, which can uniquely identify users. This study introduces BehaVR, a framework for collecting and analyzing sensor data from multiple VR apps to assess user identification risks. Using real user data from 20 apps, the research builds machine learning models that achieve up to 100% accuracy in identifying users based on sensor data. BehaVR is the first comprehensive analysis of user identification in VR across real-world apps, highlighting key features and sensor groups based on app functionality and adversary capabilities.


This repository contains BehaVR, a framework designed to analyze unique user identification within VR apps using VR sensor data (Body Motion or BM, Eye Gaze or EG, Hand Joint or HJ and Facial Expression or FE) collected by [Oculus Quest Pro](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-pro/). BehaVR was developed for and utilized in the research paper [BehaVR:User Identification Based on VR Sensor Data.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07304) Before using BehaVR, we recommend reading the paper for a comprehensive understanding of the framework.
